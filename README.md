# KY-backend-task
this is the first part of the task.
I tried to implement the user login and registration using django.
This is my first django project and open for suggesstions and please point out the mistakes if any
It can be tested using the django's server 127.0.0.1:8000
127.0.0.1:8000/admin is the admin page (username: admin password: pass@123)
127.0.0.1:8000/user/ is the main page that enables user to register if he is new or login if he is an existing user
